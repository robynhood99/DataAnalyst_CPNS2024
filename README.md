**Disclaimer: Data Update Coming Soon!**
I want to inform everyone that the current data presented regarding the 2024 CPNS registrations is preliminary. We are in the process of recalculating and updating the results to accurately reflect any changes in the status of candidatesâ€”specifically, those who have transitioned from "passed" to "not passed" and vice versa.
